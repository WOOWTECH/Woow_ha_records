"""Service registration for all four Areas.

Each Area module exports a ``SERVICE_HANDLERS`` mapping of bare verb to
handler. The Area prefix is applied here, in one place: four verbs collided
across the pre-merge domains (``export_csv``, ``create_category``,
``delete_category``, ``list_categories``), so every service carries its Area.
