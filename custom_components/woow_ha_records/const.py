"""Constants shared by every Area of the Woow HA Records integration.

One Home Assistant domain covers four Areas — finance, asset, health, note —
which share a runtime but never share data. Anything that needs to stay unique
across Areas (storage keys, service names, WebSocket commands, device
identifiers, entity unique IDs, bus events) is built from the helpers here so
the Area prefix can never be forgotten at a call site.
