"""The health Area: Members, their Record Types, and their Records.

A Member used to be a Home Assistant config entry backed by a store file of its
own. Since the merge (ADR-0001) a Member is a record inside this Area's single
store, which is what lets `health_add_member` be an ordinary write rather than a
config-flow round trip.
